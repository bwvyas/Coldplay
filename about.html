                Coldplay are a British rock band that was formed in London in 1996. Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, and drummer Will Champion met at University College London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, first calling themselves Pectoralz and then Starfish before 
                finally changing their name to Coldplay. Creative director and former manager Phil Harvey is 
                often referred to as the fifth member by the band. After changing their name to Coldplay,
                 they recorded and released two EPs: Safety in 1998 and The Blue Room in 1999. 
                 The latter was their first release on a major record label, after signing to Parlophone.</p>
                 
                 <p>Coldplay's musical style has generally been regarded as alternative rock, pop rock, post-Britpop, and pop. Chris Martin once proclaimed the band's music as "limestone rock" in comparison to "hard rock". The band's music has been called "meditative" and "blue romantic"; it "[reflects] on their emotions" and Martin "endlessly examine[s] his feelings".Coldplay started out as one of many earnest post-Britpop bands.</p>
